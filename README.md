# i3wm Configuration Files

This repository contains my personal configuration files for the [i3 window manager (i3wm)](https://i3wm.org/), a dynamic tiling window manager, on Arch Linux.

## Status Bar: Bumblebee-Status

For the status bar, I use [Bumblebee-Status](https://github.com/tobi-wan-kenobi/bumblebee-status), a modular, theme-able status line generator for the i3 window manager. I have adjusted the modules to suit my needs and have also created a personalized theme. Both the adjusted modules and the theme are included in this repository.

## Configuration

The configuration file is located in the `~/.config/i3/` directory. If you want to use this configuration, clone this repository and copy the file to your `~/.config/i3/` directory.

Please note that you may need to adjust some settings to match your personal preferences and your system's specifications.
